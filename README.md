#  Challenge 5 Work Day Scheduler

## Description

I was wanting to make a day planner to be able to plan out events for a single day.  The site will automatically check to see what the current hour is and color coordinate the hours of a typical business day with grey having already past, red representing the present, and green indicating upcoming events.  In doing this I was able to learn more of how to write functions as they relate to jQuery as well as some processes to utilize less code especially as it relates to “this”.  I was also able to utilize traversing the dom as it relates to child and parent elements.

The following is a link to the website [Work Day Scheduler site] (https://arms-like-trees.github.io/Challenge-5-Day-Planner/)

## Finished product appearances

The following shows the site scalled down so that you can see how the hours are color coded based on the current time of day.
